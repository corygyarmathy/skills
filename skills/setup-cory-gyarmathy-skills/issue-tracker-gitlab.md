# Issue tracker: GitLab

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitLab issues, worked with the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI. Where it differs from `gh`:

- Comments are notes: `glab issue note <number> --message "..."`.
- `glab issue close` takes no comment, so post the note first, then close.
- Labels change through `glab issue update <number> --label "..."` / `--unlabel "..."`.
- Pull requests are merge requests: `glab mr ...`, with `note`/`--message` in place of `comment`/`--body`.

## Merge requests as a triage surface

**MRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external merge requests as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, MRs run through the same labels and states as issues, with the `glab mr` equivalents. Triage takes only external MRs: those whose author is not a project member or owner.

GitLab numbers issues and MRs separately, so `#42` is unambiguous once you know which surface the maintainer means.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitLab issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `glab issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `glab issue create --label wayfinder:map`. (On GitLab tiers with native epics, an epic may hold the map instead; a labelled issue works everywhere.)
- **Child ticket**: an issue carrying `Part of #<map>` at the top of its description and labels `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitLab's **native blocking link**, the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add it with the `/blocked_by #<n>` quick action, posted as a note (`glab issue note <child> --message "/blocked_by #<blocker>"`). Native blocking links are a Premium/Ultimate feature; on the free tier (or where unavailable) fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the description. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: `glab issue list -O json` scoped to the map's children, drop any with an open blocker: a native `blocked_by` link to an open issue (`glab api projects/:id/issues/<child-iid>/links`), or an open issue in the `Blocked by` line, or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `glab issue update <n> --assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `glab issue note <n> --message "<answer>"`, then `glab issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
